This class comprises the activities that result in an instance of S10 Material Substantial being decreased by the removal of an amount of matter.
Typical scenarios include the removal of a component or piece of a physical object, removal of an archaeological or geological layer, taking a tissue sample from a body or a sample of fluid from a body of water. The removed matter may acquire a persistent identity of different nature beyond the act of its removal, such as becoming a physical object in the narrower sense. Such cases should be modeled by using multiple instantiation with adequate concepts of creating the respective items.

Examples:
- the removal of the layer of black overpainting that covered the background of ‘La Gioconda of the Prado’ between 2011 and 2012 by the Prado Museum in Madrid (S1) (Museo del Prado, 2012)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the activity that results in taking an amount of matter as sample for further analysis from a material substantial such as a body of water, a geological formation or an archaeological object. The removed matter may acquire a persistent identity of different nature beyond the act of its removal, such as becoming a physical object in the narrower sense. The sample is typically removed from a physical feature which is used as a frame of reference, the place of sampling. In case of non-rigid Material Substantials, the source of sampling may regarded not to be modified by the activity of sample taking.

Examples:
- the water sampling carried out by IGME, sampled from borehole 10/G5 at 419058.03, 4506565 , 95.7 Mygdonia basin on 28/6/2005 (S2) (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)
- the collection of specimen ‘FHO – Benth. - 1055’ from a plant of the species ‘spiciformis’ in Zambia by Bullock, A.A. in 1939 (S2)
- the collection of micro-sample 7, from the paint layer on the area of the apple shown on the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ (Cranach) by Joyce Plesters in June 1963 (S2) (The National Gallery, London, 1963)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises activities of taking a sample and measuring or analyzing it as one unit of activity, in which the sample is typically not identified and preserved beyond the context of this activity. Instances of this class describe the taking of one or more samples regardless whether they are explicitly identified in documentation or preserved beyond this activity. The dimensions observed by the respective measurement of this particular sample are regarded as dimensions of the instance of S10 Material Substantial at the place from which the samples were taken. Therefore, the class S3 Measurement by Sampling inherits the properties of S2 Sample Taking, O3 sampled from: S10 Material Substantial and O4 sampled at: E53 Place, and the properties of S21 Measurement O24 measured: S15 Observable Entity. It needs not instantiate the properties O5 removed: S13 Sample and O24 measured: S15 Observable Entity, if the sample is not documented beyond the context of the activity.

Examples:
- the chemical analysis 1 on 20/4/2004 which sampled from layer 50501 and observed 70 mg of Ca (S3) (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)
- the Sphaerosyllislevantina specimen length measurement on 12/3/1999 (S3) (Bekiari et al., 2014)
- the measurement of retention times during Gas Chromatography analysis of a paint sample ‘mid-blue paint for the sky’ which identified Linseed oil as the paint medium (S3) (Foister, S, 2015)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the activity of gaining scientific knowledge about particular states of physical reality through empirical evidence, experiments and measurements.
We define observation in the sense of natural sciences, as a kind of human activity: at some place and within some time-span, certain physical things and their behavior and interactions are observed by human sensory impression, and often enhanced by tools and measurement devices.
Observed situations or dimensions may pertain to properties confined to a single instance of S15 Observable Entity or pertain to constellations of multiple instances and relations between them, in particular distances between them.
The output of the internal processes of measurement devices that do not require additional human interaction are in general regarded as part of the observation and not as additional inference. Primary data from measurement devices are regarded in this model to be results of observation and can be interpreted as propositions believed to be true within the (known) tolerances and degree of reliability of the device.
Measurements and witnessing of events are special cases of observations. Observations result in a belief that certain propositions held at a time within the time-span of the observation. In this model, the degree of confidence in the observed properties is regarded to be “true” by default, but could be described differently by adding a property P3 has note to an instance of S4 Observation

Examples:
- the excavation of unit XI by the Archaeological Institute of Crete in 2004 (S4)
- the excavation (S4) in the NE section of the central court of the Knossos palace by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Heraklion in 1997 (S4) (Επιστημονική Επιτροπή Κνωσού, 2008)
- the observation of the density of the X-Ray image of cupid's head from the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ as ‘high density’, on the 19th of March 1963 (S4) (The National Gallery, London, 1963).
- the observation of visible light absorption of the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ as ‘having red pigment’, in 2015 (S4) (Foister, 2015)

This class comprises the action of making propositions and statements about particular states of affairs in reality or in possible realities or categorical descriptions of reality by using inferences from other statements based on hypotheses and any form of formal or informal logic. It includes evaluations, calculations, and interpretations based on mathematical formulations and propositions.

Examples:
- the inference made by Sakellarakis in 1980 about the sacrifice of a young man in the Minoan temple of Anemospilia based on the skeleton found (and 2 more) in the west room of the temple and the ritual bronze knife on it and the hypothesis that he died from loss of blood (S5) [the evidence was that his bones remained white in contrast to the others] (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki, 1981)

This class comprises the action of concluding propositions on a respective reality from observational data by making evaluations based on mathematical inference rules and calculations using established hypotheses, such as the calculation of an earthquake epicenter. S6 Data Evaluation is not defined as S21/E16 Measurement; Secondary derivations of dimensions of an object from data measured by different processes are regarded as S6 Data Evaluation and not determining instances of Measurement in its own right. For instance, the volume of a statue concluded from a 3D model is an instance of S6 Data Evaluation and not of Measurement.

Examples:
- the calculation of the earthquake epicenter of Lokris area in 1989 by IGME (S6) (Ganas et al., 2006)
- the calculation of the intensity distance and assignment of PGA_N using the gcf2sac software from the EPPO shock wave recording of 2/2/1990 in Athens (S6) (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)

This class comprises activities of executing algorithms or software for simulating the behavior and the properties of a system of interacting components that form part of reality or not by using a mathematical model of the respective interactions. In particular it implies making predictions about the future behaviors of a system of interacting components of reality by starting simulation from an actually observed state, such as weather forecasts. Simulations may also be used to understand the effects of a theory, to compare theoretical predictions with reality, or to show differences with another theory.

Examples:
- the forecasting of the imminent flooding of Venice in November 2012 by the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research using the Poseidon Sea Level Forecast System, 72 hours before its actual occurrence (S7) (slide 18 in Kores et al., 2013)

This class comprises the action of making categorical hypotheses based on inference rules and theories; By categorical hypotheses we mean assumptions about the kinds of interactions and related kinds of structures of a domain that have the character of “laws” of nature or human behavior, be it necessary or probabilistic. Categorical hypotheses are developed by “induction” from finite numbers of observation and the absence of observations of particular kinds. As such, categorical hypotheses are always subject to falsification by new evidence. Instances of S8 Categorical Hypothesis Building include making and questioning categorical hypotheses.

Examples:
- hypothesising that “no binding before the 9(th) century is made with spine supports” by Szirmai (S8) [documented in section 7.1 and 7.2 of “The Archaeology of Medieval bookbinding”] (Szirmai, J.A. 1999)

Examples:
- the velocity (S9) (of a station that is observed, meaning a share-wave velocity over the first 30 m). (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises fixed amounts of matter specified as some air, some water, some soil, etc., defined by the total and integrity of their material content. In order to be able to identify and recognize in practice one instance of S11 Amount of Matter, some sort of confinement is needed that serves as a constraint for the enclosed matter and the integrity of the content, such as a bottle. In contrast to instances of E18 Physical Thing, no stability of form is required. The content may be put into another bottle without losing its identity. Subclasses may define very different identity conditions for the integrity of the content, such as chemical composition, or the sequence of layers of a bore core. Whereas an instance of E18 Physical Thing may gradually change form and chemical composition while preserving its identity, such as living beings, an instance of S11 Amount of Matter may lose its identifying features by such processes. What matters for the identity of an instance of S1 Amount of Matter is the preservation of a relevant composition from the initial state of definition onwards.

Examples:
- the mass of soil that was removed from sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the central building of Zominthos in order to be sieved, during the excavation in 2006 (S11) (Archaeological Institute of America, 2006)

This class comprises a mass of matter in fluid form environmentally constraint in some persistent form allowing for identifying it for the management or research of material phenomena, such as a part of the sea, a river, the atmosphere or the milk in a bottle. Fluids are generally defined by the continuity criterion which is characteristic of their substance: their amorphous matter is continuous and tends to flow. Therefore, contiguous amounts of matter within a fluid body may stay contiguous or at least be locally spatially confined for a sufficiently long time in order to be temporarily identified and traced. This is a much weaker concept of stability of form than the one we would apply to what one would call a physical object. In general, an instance of Fluid Body may gain or lose matter over time through so-called sources or sinks in its surface, in contrast to physical things, which may lose or gain matter by exchange of pieces such as spare parts or corrosion.

This class comprises instances of E5 Event or S10 Material Substantial (i.e. items or phenomena, such as physical things, their behaviour, states and interactions or events), that can be observed by measurement or detection devices or by human sensory impression including when enhanced by tools.
In order to be observable, instances of E5 Event must consist of some interaction or action of material substance. In some cases, the spatiotemporal confinement of the event itself, such as a flash, a car stopping etc. marks the limits of a documented observation of an event. In other cases, such as the situation of a car passing by a certain object, the spatiotemporal limits of the event of observing itself, as well as the direction of attention or the orientation of used instruments, may constrain the observed detail of a larger process, e.g., noticing the sight of a car passing by; a light emission, etc.
Conceptual objects manifest through their carriers such as books, digital media, or even human memory. Attributes of conceptual objects, such as number of words, can be observed on their carriers. If the respective properties between carriers differ, either they carry different instances of conceptual objects or the difference can be attributed to accidental deficiencies in one of the carriers. In that sense even immaterial objects are observable. By this model we address the fact that frequently, the actually observed carriers of conceptual objects are not explicitly identified in documentation, i.e., they are assumed to have existed but they are unknown as individuals.

Examples:
- the domestic goose from Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) that was identified in 1996 in farmed geese in southern China as circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 (E20) (Wan, 2012)
- the flight of a male Bearded Vulture observed near Loukia, Heraklion, Crete in the morning of the 24(th) of October 2020 (E5) [The Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus Barbatus) is a threatened species in Crete] (Claes, 2020)
- the eruption of Krakatoa volcano at Indonesia in 1883 (E5) (Symons et al., 1888)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises activities of S4 Observation (substance) where an E39 Actor encounters an instance of E18 Physical Thing of a kind relevant for the mission of the observation or regarded as potentially relevant for some community (identity). This observation produces knowledge about the existence of the respective thing at a particular place in or on surrounding matter. This knowledge may be new to the group of people the actor belongs to. In that case we would talk about a discovery. The observer may recognize or assign an individual identity of the thing encountered or regard only the type as noteworthy in the associated documentation or report.
In archaeology there is a particular interest if an object is found “in situ”, i.e. if its embedding in the surrounding matter supports the assumption that the object was not moved since the archaeologically relevant deposition event. The surrounding matter with the relative position of the object in it as well as the absolute position and time of the observation may be recorded in order to enable inferences about the history of the object.
In Biology, additional parameters may be recorded like the kind of ecosystem, if the biological individual survives the observation, what detection or catching devices have been used or if the encounter event supported the detection of a new biological kind (“taxon”).

Examples:
- the finding, by Prof. Stampolidis, of a complete skeleton, in situ, at the site of Eleutherna during the archaeological excavation carried out by the University of Crete in 2007 (S19) (Bonn-Muller, 2010)
- the detection of lagocephalos_Sceleratus was carried out with the trawler 419 in the Mediteranean sea, during the first week of August 2014 (S19) (Bekiari et al., 2014)
- the encounter of the marble floor of the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum during the digging of a well in 1750 (S19) (Sider, 1990, p. 536)
- the encounter of oak planks from a ship during a dig in a mound at the farm Lille Oseberg in Norway in 1908 (S19) (Ferguson, 2009, p.10-11)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
Any instance of this class is a physical feature with sufficient stability of form in itself and with respect to the physical object bearing it in order to associate a permanent reference space within which its form is invariant and at rest. The maximum volume in space that an instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature occupies defines uniquely a place for the feature with respect to its surrounding matter.
Therefore we model S20 Rigid Physical Feature as a subclass of E26 Physical Feature and of E53 Place. The latter is intended as a phenomenal place as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss positions relative to the extent of an instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated place. However, since the identity and existence of this place depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature as matter, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language. It shortcuts an implicit self-referential path from E26 Physical Feature through P156 occupies, E53 Place, P157 is at rest relative to E26 Physical Feature.
In cases of instances of S20 Rigid Physical Feature on or in the surface of earth, the default reference is typically fixed to the closer environment of the tectonic plate or sea floor. In cases of features on mobile objects, the reference space is typically fixed to the geometry of the bearing object. Note that the reference space associated with the instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature may quite well be deformed over time, as long the continuity of its topology does not become unclear, such as the compression of dinosaur bones in geological layers, or the distortions of the hull of a ship by the waves of the sea. Defined in this way, the reference space can be used as a means to infer from current topological relationships past topological relationships of interest.

Examples:
- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock (‘Abu Simbel’, Wikipedia, 2022)
- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, 2022)
- the damaged form of the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza (‘Great Sphinx of Giza’, Wikipedia, 2022)
- the ‘Central Orygma’ (pit-house) which dominates the central part of the excavated area of the settlement of Mavropigi, representing phases I-III (Karamitrou-Mentessidi et al., 2015)
- the top surface of the clay floor A11 [Heterogeneous, yellow to grey silty clay; clear, wavy lower boundary] (illu p. 1601, Croix et al, 2019)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises physical features with relative stability of form and structure within a declared spatial volume of interest. The spatial extent of an instance of S22 Segment of Matter may be declared or defined by a researcher or observer usually because the arrangement and composition of substance is characteristic for the surrounding matter or can be interpreted as traces of its genesis and subsequent internal and external processes it was exposed to. The defining spatial extent is typically declared on a continuous matter by means of geometric determination without observable boundaries on all sides or any side. It may however be extracted at some point in time along the declared boundaries.
An instance of S22 Segment of Matter is regarded to be existing from the time on it completely solidified with a structure that is still preserved in a recognizable way at the time of its spatial definition. Its existence is regarded to end when its respective integrity is partially or completely corrupted. Uncorrupted subsections of an instance of S22 Segment of Matter may continue to exist as segments of matter in their own right beyond the existence of the containing instance, and may have solidified before it.
Typical examples are segments of archaeological or geological layers. They are regarded as uncorrupted even if they have undergone conformal deformations, such as compressions or shifts, as long as the effects of these deformations do not destroy the relevant structures of interest. This means that the defining spatial volume may be only geometrically valid for an instant of time for which it was declared, and undergo before and after deformations. In some cases, it may be possible to calculate the initial volume at the time of solidification, for instance for petrified bones compressed in Jurassic layers.

Examples:
- the clay floor A11 [Heterogeneous, yellow to grey silty clay; clear, wavy lower boundary] (illu p. 1601, Croix et al, 2019)

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="S4_Observation"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises activities of determining positions in space and time. The determined position is intended to approximate a part or all of the extent of the presence (instance of E93 Presence) of an instance of E18 Physical Thing or E4 Period of interest, such as the outer walls of an excavated settlement, the position of a ship sailing or the start and end of athlete's run in a competition. Characteristically, a theodolite or GPS device may be positioned on some persistent feature. Determining the position of the device will yield an approximation of the position of the feature of interest. Alternatively, some material item may be observed moving through a determined position at a given time.
This class does not inherit properties from class S21 Measurement. A position determination is an evaluation of a combination of measurement of multiple associated distances and/or angles (instances of E54 Dimension) from a particular spot to certain reference points of previously known position in the same reference space. A particular role is played by the Earth's magnetic field and rotational axis as reference for an angle or direction. Often, the observed constituting dimensions are not documented, or hidden in an electronic device software. The determined position is given as an E94 Space Primitive corresponding to a declarative place. Together with the measured time-span covering the time-critical observations it forms a spacetime volume, which should normally overlap with the spatiotemporal extent of the thing or phenomenon of interest.

Examples:
- the determination of the position of the Titanic for the initial distress call after hitting an iceberg (S23) [The iceberg was hit on 14 April 1912 at 23:40 ship’s time. The subsequent position determination was likely done by Capt. Edward Smith and was transmitted 15 April 1912 at 00:27.] (Halpern, 2011)
- the determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) [done between 00:27 and 00:35, when Boxhall showed the coordinates to Smith] (Halpern, 2011)
- the determination of the position of the Titanic by Robert Ballard's team after the Titanic ship-wreck was found (S23) (Ballard et al., 1987)
- Samuel Halpern’s 2007 determination of the position of the Titanic at the time of the collision (S23) [based on the position of the ship-wreck] (Halpern, 2007)

This class comprises the activity of dividing an instance of S13 Sample into new instances of S13 Sample. This activity describes cases of sub-sampling where the resulting instance maintains the characteristic qualities of the original instance. Any observations of these qualities made on the new instance also apply to the original one. This class should be used to model cases of splitting a homogenous sample into multiple ones.

Examples:
- the activity of removing a part from the sample, which was originally taken from the tusk fragment GT993 by Godfrey et al. in 2000, in order to analyse it through ICP-AES analysis to reveal the composition of the original sample [A sample from a section of the tusk fragment GT993 which was originally found in the ship-wreck of Vergulde Draeck in Western Australia was taken. This sample was homogenous (ground to fine powder). Part of the sample was then removed for elemental analysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Another part was removed for carbon/nitrogen analysis using a LECO analyser.] (Godfrey et al., 2002)

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of S4 Observation with the instance of S9 Property Type for which the observation provides a value or evidence, such as “concentration of nitrate” observed in the water from a particular borehole. Encoding the observed property by type, observed entity and value (properties O9, O10, O16) is a method to circumscribe the reification of the observed property by the respective instance of S4 Observation.
In an RDFS encoding, this circumscription can be transformed into an explicit representation of the observed property in terms of a formal ontology either by use of a reification construct or by the use of a Named Graph containing the observed property. The latter representation allows for more formal reasoning with the model, the former is more flexible about the kinds of observations.

Examples:
- The seismic hazard analysis and recording by EPPO in 1990 (S4), in the area of Attiki observed property type share wave velocity (S9) and recorded it (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)

It offers no information about how and when an E54 Dimension was established. In case the instance of S15 Observable Entity is more specifically an instance of E18 Physical Thing, using the property O12 has dimension (is dimension of) is equivalent to using the property P43 has dimension (is dimension of).

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E5 Event that triggered another instance of E5 Event with the latter. It identifies the interaction between events: an event can activate (trigger) other events in a target system that is in a situation of sustained tension, such as a trap or an unstable mountain slope giving way to a land slide after a rain or earthquake. In that sense the triggering event is interpreted as a cause. However, the association of the two events is based on their temporal proximity, with the triggering event ending when the triggered event starts.

Examples:

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E5 Event that triggered another instance of E5 Event with the latter. It identifies the interaction between events: an event can activate (trigger) other events in a target system that is in a situation of sustained tension, such as a trap or an unstable mountain slope giving way to a land slide after a rain or earthquake. In that sense the triggering event is interpreted as a cause. However, the association of the two events is based on their temporal proximity, with the triggering event ending when the triggered event starts.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The earthquake of Parnitha in 1999 (E5) triggered the rotational landslide that was observed along the road on the same day (E5). (fictitious)
- The explosion at the Montserrat massif in 2007 (E5) (near Barcelona, Spain) triggered the rock fall event (E5) which happened on 2007-02-14 (Vilajosana et al., 2008).

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of S21 Measurement with the instance of S15 Observable Entity to which it applied. An instance of S15 Observable Entity may be measured more than once. Material and immaterial things and processes may be measured, e.g. the number of words in a text, or the duration of an event.

Examples:
- The sensor measurement by IGME in 1999 (S21) measured the landslide displacement (S15) in the area of Parnitha (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)

Scope note:
This property allows an instance of E55 Type from a particular concept scheme or vocabulary to be declared as having an order relative to other instances of E55 Type in the same or other concept schemes, without necessarily having a specific value associated with either instance. This allows, for example, for an E55 Type instance representing the concept of "good" in a conservation report vocabulary to be greater than the E55 Type instance representing the concept of "average" in the same vocabulary. This property is transitive, and thus if "average" is greater than "poor", then "good" is also greater than "poor". In the domain of statistics, types that participate in this kind of relationship are called "Ordinal Variables"; as opposed to those without order which are called "Nominal Variables". This property allows for queries that select based on the relative position of participating E55 Types.

Examples:
- In the condition survey of the manuscripts of the library of the Saint Catherine Monastery, the option ‘supple’ (E55) is conceptually greater than the option ‘stiff’ (E55). [These options are used for assessing parchment on page 2, section 2 of the survey form and within the context of the dry conditions of the Sinai desert where the Monastery is, ‘supple’ is considered better because it is less brittle] (Pickwoad, 2004)

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of S23 Position Determination with the instance of E94 Space Primitive which is the result of that determination. The instance of E94 Space Primitive approximates the place occupied by the entity whose position is being determined.

Examples:
- The determination of the position of the Titanic for the initial distress call after hitting an iceberg (S23) determined position 41°44′N 50°24′W (E94). [This was quickly determined via ‘dead reckoning’, i.e. based on the distance travelled since the previous known location, extrapolating a previous dead reckoning for 14 April 1912 20:00] (Halpern, 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) determined position 41°46′N 50°14′W (E94). [This was again determined via dead reckoning but extrapolating Boxhall's own determination shortly after 20:00, and revised the original position.] (Halpern, 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The calculation of the position of the Titanic by Robert Ballard's team after the Titanic ship-wreck was found (S23) determined position 41°43′32′′N 49°56′49′′W (E94). [This was the position of the centre of the ‘boiler field’, part of the Titanic debris] (Ballard et al., 1987)
- Samuel Halpern’s 2007 determination of the position of the Titanic at the time of the collision (S23) determined position 41°45.5′N 49°55′W (E94). [This was based on the position of the boiler field and the ocean drift at the time.] (Halpern, 2007)

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of S23 Position Determination with the instance of E52 Time-Span for which the determination is valid according to the observer at the time of the observation. No inferences can be made in relation to the validity of the determination outside this time-span despite the fact that some entities are relatively stable and their positions may remain the same after the determination. The time-span of validity should fall within the overall time-span of the process of determination.

Examples:
- The determination of the position of the Titanic for the initial distress call after hitting an iceberg (S23) has validity time-span the time of the collision (E52). [This is a plausible guess based on Boxhall’s account; the collision was on 14 April 1912 23:40 ship’s time.] (Halpern, 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) has validity time-span the time of the collision (E52).
